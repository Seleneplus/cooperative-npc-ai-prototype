# Cooperative NPC AI Prototype

This project implements a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**-based AI prototype for cooperative NPCs (Non-Player Characters) in a grid-based game environment.  
Two types of NPCs must **rendezvous** to exchange information before they can locate and deliver to the target location.  
The project demonstrates **multi-agent collaboration**, **reinforcement learning**, and **game environment simulation**.
